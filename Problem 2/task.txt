Write a function solution that, given two integers A and B, returns the number of integers from the range [A..B] (ends are included) which can be expressed as the product of two consecutive integers, that is X * (X + 1), for some integer X.

Examples:
1. Given A = 6 and B = 20, the function should return 3. These integers are: 6 = 2 * 3, 12 = 3 * 4 and 20 = 4 * 5.
2. Given A = 21 and B = 29, the function should return 0. There are no integers of the form X * (X + 1) in this interval.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

A and B are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
A â‰¤ B.
